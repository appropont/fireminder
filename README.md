# Fireminder

Fireminder is a simple desktop application that watches urls and makes sure they are accessible.

There are existing paid services that provide more robust features, functionality, and reliability. You are strongly encouraged to consider them for your use case.

Sometimes, however, you just need something fairly simple (and free). That is this.

## Releases
This repo is for the development version of Fireminder.

If you would like to just download the application and run it, you can find OS specific packages at [https://appropont.com/projects/fireminder](https://appropont.com/projects/fireminder)
